# Why I Love Python
A balanced, objective, and unbiased view on why Python (Python 3, that is) is the best programming language. Ever.

## What was Cool When I Was First Learning Python
- I came from writing code in Java and C++ and someone told me I should try out Python. 
- Note that a lot of these things that are available in a lot of modern langauges (like Kotlin, Javascript, etc).
- I haven't yet gone back to Java or C++ since. Here were some of the things I loved.
- If you know how to code and want a place to start, check out the Python Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html.

### 1. So Simple To Write
- Great levels of abstraction
         - If I want to print something, I don't have to think about input and output
Java:
```java
import static java.lang.System.out;
System.out.println("Hello World")
```

Python:
```python
print("Hello World")
```

### 2. There's a lot that comes right out of the box.
- For example, everything you could imagine you would want to do with a String (`str`), is built in
        - https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods
        - `isalpha`, `beginswith`, `endswith`, `isupper`, `upper`, `split`
 ```python
 >>> '1,2,3'.split(',')
['1', '2', '3']
```

1. Readability
2. A Taste of Functional Programming
3. Iterators
4. Type Annotations
